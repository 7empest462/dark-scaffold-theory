# Theoretical Lineage of the Dark Scaffold

### 1. Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC) & Hawking Points
The DST "Remnant" hypothesis aligns with Roger Penrose’s CCC, which suggests the universe undergoes infinite cycles (aeons). 
* **The Scaffold:** Anomalous circular spots in the CMB (Hawking Points) represent the final evaporation of supermassive black holes from the *previous* aeon. 
* **The Connection:** These points act as the initial "cracks" or gravitational seeds that guided the seepage of our current Big Bang matter.

### 2. The Dark Dimension
Linked to 2024-2025 string theory research, this suggests our 4D world is "stacked" against a larger dark dimension. The "Scaffold" is the gravitational footprint of matter existing in that higher-dimensional state.
